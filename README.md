**`Software Developer/Cross-platform Fullstack Developer`**

<hr>

<p>
Hi there, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/l-alvaro/">√Ålvaro Lozano</a>. I am a Software Developer and former Translator/Interpreter based in Spain. I have always been interested in technology and computers but it wasn't until a few years ago, after I finished my Bachelor of Arts in Translation, that I decided to take the plunge and swap careers by pursuing an Associate's Degree (might also be known as higher vocational degree) in Cross-platform Development. Below you may find some of the projects and repos I've made throughout my nascent coding foray as well as a few of my key points as a professional.
